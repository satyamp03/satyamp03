- 👋 Hi, I’m @satyamp03
- 🏫 I graduated from The University of British Columbia with a BSc Combined Honours in Physics and Astronomy in May 2023.
- 👀 I am currently working as a Research Technician at the deBoer Lab in the School of Biomedical Engineering at UBC. My role involves developing robust frameworks for the standardized evaluation of genomic deep learning models through the use of APIs.
  - Leveraging high-performance computing resources, I design scalable, containerized environments to ensure reproducibility and streamline model assessment across diverse genomics datasets.
